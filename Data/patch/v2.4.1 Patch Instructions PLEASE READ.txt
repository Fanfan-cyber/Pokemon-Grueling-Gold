Once you have extracted this, read the following:

If this is the first time you're patching, you need to copy EVERYTHING
and paste it into the Pokemon Grueling Gold folder. However, if
you have patched before, unless specifically stated below
or in the Discord, you do not need to overwrite the
Graphics folder again. Just copy the Data folder and the version file
and paste it directly into your Pokemon Grueling Gold folder.
When it asks you if you want to overwrite, say yes to all.

If you are updating from 2.4.0, the current version does NOT need a Graphics
folder update. If you're on an earlier version, please be sure you overwrite
all the graphics files when asked.

If you are interested in doing an expert mode run and having it continue, edit the run_counter
and expert_name files in this folder and drag them into your Data folder before applying the
patch. This will change your name and run count to whatever you choose. You can open these
files in Notepad.
